| 9:00am-10:00am  | Steve Fisher          | Keynote - Conflict is the Key to Great User Experiences      | It's time to kick all of the elephants out of the room. Letting go of preconceived notions is a requisite skill for creating whole-hearted user experiences. In his talk, Steve will help you look at your current projects through a vulnerable lens to see imperfections, pre-empt design oversights, and let go of personal defense mechanisms that interfere with the creative process. This session will give you the tools to free project teams to express true creativity, to bond and to connect at a deeper level with each other and the people using our products and designs. What is the best makeup of any given project team? Why should you mine for conflict and how does it enable you to produce better designs? Find out the answers to all these questions and more!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | UX        |      |
| 10:00am-10:45am | Tiffany Tse           | Style Guides: Best Practices and Workflow for Web Developers | With responsive websites being an expectation in today's web landscape, we need to maintain the complexity and flexibility of a system by designing and building individual components that move and reflow within layouts. Style Guides are a mechanism to style most (if not all) of your site's themable elements in one place, and have quickly become the foundational tool for tackling an increasingly-diverse web landscape. Getting greater theme coverage allows your site builders and content managers to dynamically add new pages and layouts to your site, all while keeping the look and feel intact and maintaining a consistent experience for the end user. Style Guides give designers and developers a platform to create a shared vocabulary, building out components of a system instead of 'pages' to a website, and deciding on markup together. This session will feature best practices for creating Style Guides, as well as outline other essential tools for theme development and collaboration. | UX        | [Slides and links](http://slides.com/tset/styleguides) |

| 11:00am-11:45pm | Frederic Harper       | Responsive Web Design, get the best of your design           | There is no mobile Web, there is no desktop Web, and there is no tablet Web. We view the same Web just in different ways. So how do we do it? By getting rid of our fixed-width, device-specific approaches and use Responsive Web Design techniques. This session will focus on what is Responsive Web Design and how you can use his 3-pronged approach on your current apps today which will also adapt to new devices in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Front-End | [Slides and video recording](http://outofcomfortzone.net/2015/06/25/responsive-web-design-javaScript-open-day-vancouver/) |

| 1:00pm-1:45pm   | Morten Rand-Henriksen | Responsive Images in Real Life                               | Responsive Images are one of the missing pieces in the puzzle that makes up our new responsive web. Using the new RICG spec for srcset, sizes, and the picture element, web designers and developers can instruct the browser to serve the visitor with the best possible image for their screen resolution and size, all the while saving bandwidth and processing power. Learn how the new spec and markup works, how and when to use srcset, sizes, and the picture element, and how to implement Responsive Images in your live production sites today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Front-End | [Slides and links](http://mor10.com/jsopenvan2015/) |

ECMAScript 6 (ES6) is the next major release of the ECMAScript language specification a.k.a. JavaScript. In this talk, Rami will be showcasing some of the features proposed in the current ES6 draft along with examples on how to use them, why these features are important and why you should care. Rami will also show you a survey of ES6 feature compatibility across all the major browsers and platforms as well as showcase some Node.js modules using these new features to big success. Features like block scoping, destructuring, modules & classes, proxies, collections, iterators & generators and arrow functions, etc... will be showcased.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | JS        | [JS Open Day Vancouver - Whats New ES6.pdf](https://github.com/sayar/jsopenday/blob/master/vancouver/JS%20Open%20Day%20Vancouver%20-%20Whats%20New%20ES6.pdf) |

| 3:15pm-4:00pm   | Pearl Chen            | JavaScript for the Physical World                            | If you know enough JavaScript to be dangerous, you (yes, you!) can interact with the physical world via sensors. lights, and motors. Not only do you not need an electrical engineering degree to start hacking with hardware, you don't even need to learn a new language! In this session, I'll go over a few microcontroller boards that play well with JavaScript, show a demo or two, and share resources on how you can get started with hardware.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | JS        |      |
| 4:00pm-4:45pm   | Tommy Lewis           | JavaScript Will Kill Us All                                  | Singer & songwriter Taylor Swift once wrote a song about JavaScript in which she sang "the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate..."* Taylor understood our plight of being a JavaScript developer and how soon there will be so much JavaScript on the planet that it will lead to the demise of our civilization as we know it unless we do something drastically about it. In this session, Tommy will talk about JavaScript's never-ending encroachment of all things from "native apps" to the Internet of Things and what that means for humanity. How JavaScript has enabled some of our most beautiful, earthly digital experiences.  As well as how dogmatism has taken us a step back and that if we can learn to embrace openness, we will find that JavaScript can take us across the universe & avoid the apocalypse. * - May not be factual.                                                                                                                                                      | JS        |      |
