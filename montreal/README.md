| Fred Harper       | The secret sauce, responsive web design              | There is no mobile or desktop Web: we view the same Web, but in different ways. So what is the secret sauce to give the best experience to our users? Drown your fixed-width design, destroy your device-specific approaches and ride the web's unicorn while an orchestra is playing we are the champion in the background: you found the holy grail! It's responsive web design. It's not new. It's not magical. Still, we need it as the bytes going thru the wires doesn't always give us the best experience out there.

| Carla Morawicz    | Say Hello to my Little Friend : Javascript           | If you’re like me, then you’ve probably just jumped right into web technologies and started using Javascript out of the box. But then you’re probably not using JS to its fullest extent and are missing out on a lot of the cool features. I’m here to bring to you from zero to hero and hopefully shed some much needed light on the basics of JS and the proper etiquette to using it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | JavaScript            | [Slides](https://github.com/sayar/jsopenday/raw/master/montreal/Say%20Hello%20To%20My%20Little%20Friend%20JavaScript.pdf) |
| Marek Zaluski     | Predicting the Evolution of the JavaScript Ecosystem | The JavaScript landscape is evolving fast. New tools, frameworks and trends come and go at a rapid pace. How to tell the good ideas apart from the fads? How to predict the winners of the framework wars? How to decide where to invest time as a developer? In this talk we'll analyze the big picture to predict how JavaScript will mature and evolve beyond the current frameworks and beyond ES6 -- including WebAssembly -- and we'll look at where to place your bets as a developer for the future.                                                                                                                                                                                            | Frameworks            | [Slides](https://github.com/sayar/jsopenday/raw/master/montreal/JS%20Open%20Day%20-%20Evolution%20of%20JavaScript%20Ecosystems%20(Marek%20Zaluski).pdf) |
| Rami Sayar        | Here Be Dragons - JavaScript Debugging               | Have you ever cried yourself to sleep unable to find the cause of a horrendous bug in your node app? Cry no more, your tears will be reshaped as blinding swords as we explore uncharted territories laced with mystical creatures. JavaScript debugging is an often avoided topic due to the uncertainty of how best to accomplish it and the lack of powerful introspective tools. This talk will explore new territory and showcase tools that help you debug complex and difficult issues in your node or frontend app. Libraries and tools such as node-debugger, Visual Studio Code, vorlon.js, nGrok will be used to slay dragons. No more shall you fear building complex apps with JavaScript! | Debugging             | [Slides](https://github.com/sayar/jsopenday/raw/master/montreal/JS%20Open%20Day%20-%20Keynote%20-%20JavaScript%20Debugging.pdf) |
| Nicolas Kruchten  | JavaScript for Data Visualization                    | While Python and R battle it out for dominance of the data analysis world, Javascript is virtually unchallenged as the tool of choice for innovative, interactive data visualizations. This talk will provide a short intro to data visualization and then take you on a tour of the technology stack available to Javascript developers for dataviz. We'll cover the tradeoffs between the lower-level rendering options like SVG, Canvas and WebGL, talk about data manipulation, layout and interactivity with D3.js and then finish off with a discussion of when and why to use one of the many higher-level charting libraries available.                                                         | Data Visualization    | [Slides](https://goo.gl/77dwl5) [Video](https://youtu.be/qLh_wNbslrI)    |
